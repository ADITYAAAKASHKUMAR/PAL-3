# 🚆 Indian Train Ticket Waitlist Predictor  

A fun (and painfully accurate) train ticket predictor! Part of **Project After Learning -3 (PAL-3)**. 😆  

## 🎟️ What It Does  
- Takes your **PNR number** (real or fake, doesn’t matter)  
- Checks if you have **"railway connections"** 🚂  
- Predicts your fate: **Still WL234!** 🚨  

## 🤔 Why Use It?  
- More reliable than **Tatkal at 10:00 AM**  
- Saves you from refreshing **IRCTC every 5 min**  
- Suggests the **best backup plan: Take a bus.** 🚌  

## 🚀 How to Use  
1. Download or clone this repo  
2. Open `index.html` in your browser  
3. Laugh, cry, and book a bus instead  

_*This project is as reliable as IRCTC servers. Use at your own risk!*_ 😂
